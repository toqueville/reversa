# Opportunity and transformation schema

Minimum contract for the artifacts the Code Quality team writes. YAML front matter + Markdown body. Atomic writing (tempfile + rename, UTF-8 without BOM).

## opportunities/<id>.md

```yaml

schema_version: 1

display_number: <n>                  # human-friendly global alias, highest existing + 1
context: <context-slug>
verb: restructure | modularize | decouple | optimize | simplify | standardize | prune

## Rules

- Confirmed `soul` and `specs` that touch the target are always consulted. A confirmed business rule is never violated nor treated as dead code.
- States are monotonic in the audit sense: `declined` and `reverted` preserve history, never erase the record.
- `prune` only marks `state: applied` with `preservation.method: death-proof` and the proof attached. A suspected orphan stays `proposed` with `promoted_to: null`.
