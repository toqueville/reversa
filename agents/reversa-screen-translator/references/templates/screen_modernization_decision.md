> When `mode: skipped`, this decision **did not go through a human**: it was emitted automatically by the Screen Translator because the legacy has no UI. Only the "Context" and "Decision" sections are filled, with the reason for omission; the rest are marked N/A. The Inspector reads `mode: skipped` in the front-matter and skips visual parity without asking.


# Screen Modernization Decision

> Conscious decision on how to translate the legacy system screens: byte-by-byte observable parity, idiomatic redesign for the target platform, or per-screen combination.
> This artifact is mandatory reading for the Screen Translator itself (to generate `target_screens.md`), for the Inspector (to build parity tests suited to the mode), and for the coding agent.

## Context

- **Detected source platform**: <slug> (e.g.: `cobol-ansi-tui`, `delphi-vcl`, `asp-classic`, `android-xml`)
- **Confidence**: 🟢 CONFIRMED | 🟡 INFERRED | 🔴 GAP | ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS
- **Target platform**: <slug> (e.g.: `go-cli`, `web-spa`, `flutter`, `tauri`)
- **Screens inventoried**: <N>
- **Inventory source**: `_reversa_sdd/screens/inventory.json` + `_reversa_sdd/ui/inventory.md`
- **Adapter applied**: `<adapters/source__target>` (see `references/adapter-pairs.md`)

## Evaluated modes

### Mode: literal
- **Definition**: byte-by-byte or pixel-equivalent observable parity between legacy and new.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Implementation cost: <high | medium | low>
  - Visual fidelity: <high | medium | low>
  - Feasibility of constructive parity tests: <yes | partial | no>
  - Expected end-user acceptance: <high | medium | low>
  - Future technical debt: <high | medium | low>
- **Recommended**: <yes | no>
- **Justification**: <short text>

### Mode: modernized
- **Definition**: idiomatic redesign for the target platform, preserving information and flow, but re-expressing hierarchy and interaction.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Implementation cost: <high | medium | low>
  - Visual fidelity: <high | medium | low>
  - Feasibility of constructive parity tests: <yes | partial | no>
  - Expected end-user acceptance: <high | medium | low>
  - Future technical debt: <high | medium | low>
- **Recommended**: <yes | no>
- **Justification**: <short text>

### Mode: hybrid
- **Definition**: part of the screens in literal, part in modernized, with explicit lists.
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Implementation cost: <high | medium | low>
  - Mixed visual fidelity: <description>
  - Parity test feasibility: <description per subset>
  - Cost of maintaining the separation: <high | medium | low>
- **Recommended**: <yes | no>
- **Justification**: <short text>

## Decision

- **Chosen mode**: <literal | modernized | hybrid>
- **Human justification**: <text>
- **Discarded alternatives**: <brief list with reason>
- **Decided on**: <ISO-8601>
- **Decided by**: <name or identifier>

### In hybrid mode, explicit lists (mandatory)

**Screens in literal mode**:
- <screen 1>
- <screen 2>

**Screens in modernized mode**:
- <screen 3>
- <screen 4>

> Empty lists block Phase 2. The agent refuses to proceed.

## Pending implications for Phase 2

| Step | Implication | How to honor |
|---|---|---|
| Generation of `target_screens.md` | <implication> | <expected action> |
| Golden file capture | <implication> | <expected action> |
| Design-system tokens | <implication> | <expected action> |
| Textual content | Preserve literal unless explicit approval of linguistic revision | <expected action> |

## Implications for the Inspector

- **Parity strategy**:
  - Literal mode → byte-by-byte / pixel-equivalent observable parity, validated by golden files when the oracle executes.
  - Modernized mode → semantic contract (events, transitions, textual content, states), no byte-by-byte visual comparison.
  - Hybrid mode → mixed strategy, declared per screen in `parity_specs.md`.
- **Known deviations to propagate**: see `screen_deviation_log.md`.

## Notes

<Additional points that the coder, the Inspector, and the agent need to know to honor the decision. Includes, for example, explicit approval of linguistic revision, tolerance for approximate rendering, or marking of screens that do not admit modernization due to regulatory requirements.>
