# Step 4 — Semantic regression check

> This step only runs on **re-extractions**, meaning when a reverse pipeline is executed on a project that has already gone through at least one `/reversa-coding` cycle. In projects without `_reversa_forward/` or without `regression-watch.md`, the regression check is silently skipped (the "Addenda reconciliation" at the end is still checked).

## Why it exists

Reversa is not just a one-shot extraction. Each `/reversa-coding` leaves in `_reversa_forward/<feature>/regression-watch.md` a list of rules that must remain true in the next extraction. The reverse pipeline, when re-run, has the duty to check these rules against the current code and report regressions. This is Reversa's competitive differentiator compared to pure forward frameworks.

## When to run

After the **last agent in the plan** completes, before the final "extraction complete" message. The trigger is position (last item in `.reversa/plan.md`), not agent name, because the last agent varies depending on the optionals selected during install (Reviewer may be absent, for example). Perform the checks in order:

1. Check if `_reversa_forward/` exists at the project root. If it does not exist, skip directly to the "Addenda reconciliation" section.
2. List all subfolders of `_reversa_forward/` that contain `regression-watch.md`.
3. If the list is empty, skip directly to the "Addenda reconciliation" section.
4. Otherwise, proceed with the procedure below, one feature at a time.

## Procedure per feature

For each `_reversa_forward/<feature>/regression-watch.md`:

1. Load the file. Identify the main watch items table (columns `ID | Origin | Expected rule after change | Verification type | Violation signal`).
2. For each watch item in the main table (not the archived ones):
   2.1. Identify the `Verification type`, possible values: `presence`, `absence`, `wording`, `confidence`.
   2.2. Apply the corresponding verification against the newly generated artifacts in `_reversa_sdd/`:
        - `presence`: the rule must be present in `_reversa_sdd/domain.md` (or in the file indicated by the Origin column) with the same semantic essence.
        - `absence`: the original rule must NO longer appear in the SDD.
        - `wording`: the text was deliberately altered; check if the new version matches the expectation.
        - `confidence`: the rule is still present, but the confidence (🟢, 🟡, 🔴) must be equal to or higher than expected.
   2.3. Assign a verdict:
        - 🟢 **green** — the expectation was fully met.
        - 🟡 **yellow** — there is semantic equivalence but the text differs, or the evidence is partial. Default verdict when there is ambiguity. Awaits human judgment.
        - 🔴 **red** — the expectation was NOT met. A previously confirmed rule became a violated rule.
3. After evaluating all watch items, update the `## Re-extraction history` section of the same `regression-watch.md` by adding a dated block:

```
### Re-extraction YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

| ID | Verdict | Observation |
|----|---------|-------------|
| W001 | 🟢 green | rule preserved in _reversa_sdd/domain.md#rule-X |
| W005 | 🔴 red | rule removed from current code; unintended change |
| W010 | 🟡 yellow | equivalent text but differs literally; awaiting judgment |
```

4. DO NOT alter the main watch items table. DO NOT recycle IDs. DO NOT move watch items to "Archived" automatically.

5. For each watch item with three consecutive green verdicts in the history, and provided `setup.json#watch.archive-after` allows it, move the item from the main table to the `## Archived` section at the end of the file. Keep the original ID.

## Write policy

- Atomic write (tempfile plus rename) on `regression-watch.md`.
- Never rewrite or delete entries from the re-extraction history.
- The new re-extraction block always goes at the top of the `## Re-extraction history` section (descending order).

## Report to the user

After processing all features, present:

1. Total features checked
2. Total watch items checked
3. Breakdown by verdict: greens, yellows, reds
4. Detailed list of reds (ID, feature, rule, reason for divergence)
5. Detailed list of yellows that requested human judgment

If there is at least one red, present a highlighted warning:

> 🔴 **Attention** — **N semantic regressions** were detected in previously coded features. Review before proceeding.

If `setup.json#watch.block-on-red` is `true`, suggest to the user **not** to proceed with new `/reversa-requirements` until each red is triaged. Reversa only alerts; it never automatically blocks the user's flow.

## Addenda reconciliation

After processing the features (or even if none have `regression-watch.md`), check if `_reversa_sdd/addenda/` exists with `.md` files created by `/reversa-sync`. If it exists:

1. For each addendum whose `## Validity` section does NOT contain the line `Superseded by the re-extraction of ...`, append to the end of that section the line:

   ```
   Superseded by the re-extraction of YYYY-MM-DD.
   ```

2. Never delete the addendum, never rewrite previous lines in the Validity section, never touch other sections. Append-only, atomic write.
3. Addenda already superseded in previous re-extractions remain as they are (they are history).
4. Include in the user report how many addenda were marked as superseded in this re-extraction.

The reason: addenda are bridges between a forward delivery and the re-extraction. With the extraction regenerated from the current code, the deltas described in the addenda are already absorbed into the main artifacts, and consumers (e.g., `/reversa-requirements` and `/reversa-plan`) should only consider active addenda.

## Special case — without `_reversa_sdd/`

If during the procedure `_reversa_sdd/` does not have the expected files (because the re-extraction was partial or the documentation level was reduced), record a 🟡 yellow verdict with the observation `evidence absent, _reversa_sdd/<file> was not generated in this extraction` and move on.

## Known limitation

Semantic equivalence between the expected rule and the extracted rule is a subjective evaluation. When in doubt, prefer a yellow verdict. A red verdict should be reserved for cases where the rule simply disappeared or was explicitly contradicted.
