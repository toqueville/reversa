# Highcharts Visualizer

Creates professional data visualizations using Highcharts.js. Always generates **standalone HTML**
(single file, self-contained) with interactive, animated, responsive, and accessible charts.

## Workflow

### 1. Receive the Data

Data can come from:

- **Inline in the conversation** → User pastes data, table, list of values
- **CSV/JSON sent** → Analyze the content using `view_file` and inject the data directly into the generated HTML. Never create Python scripts.
- **Excel spreadsheet** → Extract data from the tables and inject them into the HTML. Do not use Python.
- **Sample data** → When the user wants to explore a chart type without real data
- **Data URL** → Use `web_fetch` to retrieve remote data

### 2. Analyze the Data

Before generating the chart, understand the nature of the data:

- **Dimensions**: how many series? How many categories? Temporal or categorical?
- **Scale**: value range, outliers, distribution
- **Relationships**: comparison, composition, distribution, trend, correlation
- **Volume**: few points (<100), medium (100-10K), large (>10K — use boost module)

Analyze the data internally after reading and inject the tags via string. Do not create intermediate Python programs.

### 3. Choose the Chart Type

Consult `references/CHART_CATALOG.md` for the complete catalog of 40+ chart types,
with guidance on when to use each one.

**Quick decision rule:**

| Goal | Recommended types |
|------|-------------------|
| Trend over time | line, area, spline, areaspline |
| Comparison between categories | column, bar, lollipop, bullet |
| Composition / proportion | pie, donut, stacked column, stacked area, treemap, sunburst |
| Distribution | histogram, box plot, scatter, bell curve |
| Correlation | scatter, bubble, heatmap |
| Flow / process | sankey, dependency wheel, network graph |
| Hierarchy | treemap, sunburst, organization chart |
| Geographic | map (Highcharts Maps module) |
| Financial / timeline | stock chart (candlestick, OHLC, flags) |
| Progress / KPI | gauge, solid gauge, activity gauge |
| Project / planning | gantt chart |
| Funnel / conversion | funnel, pyramid |

If the user did not specify the type, suggest 2-3 options that best represent the data.

### 4. Generate the Code

Consult `references/HIGHCHARTS_PATTERNS.md` for tested code patterns.

**Fundamental rules:**

1. **Standalone HTML**: single `.html` file. When run by the Reversa Docs Team, Highcharts comes from `assets/vendor/` (downloaded by the Publisher via `vendor-pins.yaml`). When run standalone, CDN is accepted as fallback but the preferred path is local.
2. **Pinned version**: `highcharts@11.4.8`. Core and modules must be the same version.
3. **On-demand modules**: only include extra scripts when necessary (see modules table).
4. **Accessibility always**: always include `assets/vendor/highcharts-accessibility.js`.
5. **Exporting always**: always include `assets/vendor/highcharts-exporting.js`.
6. **Responsive**: the chart must adapt to the container/viewport.
7. **Consistent theme**: apply cohesive colors and professional typography.
8. **Animation**: enable entry animations and smooth transitions.
9. **Rich tooltips**: formatted tooltips, with units and context.
10. **Large data**: for >10K points, include `modules/boost.js` (needs to be added to `vendor-pins.yaml`).
11. **No `fetch()` for local files**: data comes from `window.RV_DATA.metrics` (or `window.RV_DATA.timeline`), loaded by `assets/js/data.js`.

**Required modules by chart type (preference: local path in `assets/vendor/`):**

| Resource | Local (when run by Docs team) | Fallback CDN |
|----------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| Core (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts.js` | `https://code.highcharts.com/11.4.8/highcharts.js` |
| Accessibility (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts-accessibility.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/accessibility.js` |
| Exporting (required) | `assets/vendor/highcharts-exporting.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/exporting.js` |
| Treemap | `assets/vendor/highcharts-treemap.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/treemap.js` |
| Sankey | `assets/vendor/highcharts-sankey.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/sankey.js` |
| Timeline | `assets/vendor/highcharts-timeline.js` | `.../11.4.8/modules/timeline.js` |
| Others (Sunburst, Heatmap, Funnel, etc) | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../11.4.8/modules/<module>.js` |
| Stock (candlestick, OHLC) | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../stock/11.4.8/highstock.js` |
| Maps | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../maps/11.4.8/highmaps.js` |
| Gantt | add to `vendor-pins.yaml` before using | `.../gantt/11.4.8/highcharts-gantt.js` |

> If a page needs a module that is **not yet** in `vendor-pins.yaml`, the correct path is:
> 1. Ask the Publisher to add the pin (commit in this skill or open an issue), with primary URL + fallbacks.
> 2. Only then use the module.
> Pointing directly to CDN in final pages breaks the invariant "works via `file://` without internet".

All CDNs (fallback) in the format: `https://code.highcharts.com/11.4.8/{path}`.

### 5. Save and Deliver

Save the generated HTML directly to the destination folder using `write_to_file`. Always generate the pure HTML file with all data processed and injected into the `<script>` variables. Do not use Python snippets.

## Quality Guidelines

- **Professional aesthetics**: cohesive colors (use Highcharts palettes or custom), clean typography, proper spacing
- **Formatted data**: numbers with thousands separators, localized dates, units on axes
- **Clear legends**: descriptive series names, positioned so as not to obstruct the data
- **Rich interactivity**: hover highlights, contextual tooltips, zoom when applicable
- **Dark mode**: when appropriate, offer a dark version with `backgroundColor: '#1a1a2e'`
- **Multiple charts**: for dashboards, organize in a responsive CSS grid
- **Commented code**: comments explaining each section
