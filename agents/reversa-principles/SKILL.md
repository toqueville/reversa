You are the guardian of principles. This skill handles enduring project rules, separate from the specific requirements of each feature. Principles change little and influence all other artifacts.

This skill is rare, typically triggered less than once a month. It is NOT part of the `requirements`, `plan`, `to-do`, `coding` pipeline. It can run on its own, even before the first feature.

## Before you begin

1. Read `.reversa/state.json` to resolve `output_folder` and `forward_folder`
2. Use the actual values wherever the text mentions `_reversa_sdd/` or `_reversa_forward/`

## Initial Checks

1. Try to read `.reversa/principles.md`
   1.1. If absent, mode is `create`
   1.2. If present, mode is `update`
2. Apply `before-principles` in the standard way

## Create mode

1. Load `.reversa/templates/principles-template.md`
2. Ask the user for candidate principles, in batch or one at a time
3. For each principle:
   3.1. Assign sequential Roman numbering (I, II, III, ...)
   3.2. Ask for a short title, description, and a concrete application example
   3.3. Record the creation date
4. In the "Impact" section, list which templates will be affected when the principle changes (always `requirements-template.md`, `roadmap-template.md`, and potentially `actions-template.md`)
5. Start the "Change History" section with the initial entry

## Update mode

1. Present the user with the current list of numbered principles
2. Ask which operation they want:
   2.1. Add new (continues with the next Roman numeral, never recycles)
   2.2. Change the text of an existing one (keeps numbering, records the change in the history)
   2.3. Retire one (does NOT delete, marks as `retired on YYYY-MM-DD` and moves to the end of the document)
3. After the operation:
   3.1. Update the "Impact" section if necessary
   3.2. Add an entry to "Change History"

## Impact propagation

1. For each template listed in the "Impact" section:
   1.1. Read the template at `.reversa/templates/<name>`
   1.2. Check whether the template needs a new placeholder or section to reflect the principle
   1.3. NEVER rewrite the entire template automatically; generate only an impact report at `.reversa/principles-impact-YYYYMMDD.md`
2. The report lists, per template, textual adjustment suggestions
3. Applying those suggestions is the human's decision; this skill only suggests

## Persistence

- Write `.reversa/principles.md` with atomic writing
- Write the impact report at `.reversa/principles-impact-YYYYMMDD.md`
- Never overwrite old impact reports; each execution creates a dated file

## Post-execution Hooks

Apply `after-principles` in the standard way.

## Final report to the user

1. Absolute path of `principles.md`
2. List of active principles, with numbering and short title
3. List of retired principles, if any
4. Path of the generated impact report
5. Notice: new or changed principles only take effect in features started after this date
