# Paradigm Catalog

> Structured knowledge about paradigms and how they relate to common stacks.
> Updating this catalog is a maintenance task independent of the Paradigm Advisor agent.

## Paradigm catalog

### Procedural
- **Characteristics**: top-level functions, linear flow in controllers, absence of classes or ornamental usage, data as dicts/structs, open side effects.
- **Legacy examples**: classic PHP scripts, COBOL batch, pre-OO Perl systems, shell scripts.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: domain described as "functions", linear flows in `process_flows`, absence of explicit aggregates.

### Classic OO
- **Characteristics**: class hierarchy, strong inheritance, Active Record pattern, logic coupled to models, framework dictates structure.
- **Legacy examples**: monolithic Rails, traditional Django, pre-DI Java EE, .NET WebForms / classic.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: classes with broad responsibilities, inheritance in domain model, anemic controllers calling model methods.

### OO with DI
- **Characteristics**: injection containers, explicit interfaces, Repository / Service pattern, clear layer separation.
- **Legacy examples**: modern Spring, .NET 6+, NestJS, modern Symfony.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: explicit aggregates, repository interfaces, absence of Active Record.

### Functional
- **Characteristics**: dominant immutability, pure functions, composition, absence of implicit side effects, rich typing.
- **Legacy examples**: Haskell, Elm, F#, functional Scala, Clojure.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: algebraic types, absence of classes, flow expressed as composition.

### Event-driven (asynchronous)
- **Characteristics**: queues / topics, decoupled handlers, absence of linear flow, eventual consistency, explicit idempotency.
- **Legacy examples**: modern Node backends oriented to queues, SQS / Kafka heavy systems, asynchronous microservices.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: events in domain model, integrations via queue, long-running processes with retry.

### Actor model
- **Characteristics**: isolated actors with mailbox, supervision, state isolation.
- **Legacy examples**: Erlang / Elixir / OTP, Akka.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: supervised processes, messages between actors.

### Dataflow
- **Characteristics**: declarative pipelines, stream transformations, absence of imperative loops in the domain.
- **Legacy examples**: classic ETLs, Spark, Flink.
- **Signals in `_reversa_sdd/`**: description as DAG, stage-based transformations.

## Stack -> natural paradigm mapping

| Target stack | Natural paradigm | Viable alternatives | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Node.js 20 (Fastify, Express, NestJS) | event-driven asynchronous | OO with DI (NestJS), light functional | async-first runtime; heavy CPU blocking goes to worker threads |
| Go (net/http, Echo, Fiber) | CSP / goroutines (light event-driven) | structured procedural | concurrency via channels; OO simulated via interfaces |
| Rust (axum, Actix, tokio) | ownership / async functional | event-driven | immutability by default, safety via types |
| Elixir / Phoenix | actor model (BEAM) | functional | supervision via OTP |
| Modern Python (FastAPI, Django 5) | OO with DI or rich procedural | event-driven (Celery, asyncio) | choice depends on framework |
| Kotlin (Spring Boot, Ktor) | OO with DI | event-driven (Reactor) | coroutines enable ergonomic async |
| .NET 8 (ASP.NET Core, Minimal API) | OO with DI | event-driven (Channels, MediatR) | OO tradition + first-class asynchronism |
| Modern Java (Spring Boot 3, Quarkus) | OO with DI | event-driven (Project Reactor) | functional libraries possible but not dominant |
| Modern Ruby (Rails 7, Hanami) | classic OO (Rails) or OO with DI (Hanami) | light functional (dry-rb) | Rails dictates Active Record; Hanami is DI-heavy |
| TypeScript serverless (AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers) | event-driven | functional | event-triggered invocation; cold start influences design |

## Typical gaps table by pair

| From -> To | Main gap | Concrete implications |
|---|---|---|
| procedural -> event-driven | synchrony -> asynchronism | response is no longer immediate; error handling becomes retry/DLQ; idempotency mandatory; event ordering starts to matter |
| procedural -> OO with DI | data as dict -> aggregates | invariants live inside aggregates; logic leaves controllers; dependencies via interfaces |
| procedural -> functional | open side effects -> pure + isolated | mutability becomes the exception; composition replaces sequence; algebraic types for states |
| classic OO -> event-driven | synchronous flow -> choreography | actions are no longer atomic; distributed transactions become sagas; strong consistency -> eventual |
| classic OO -> OO with DI | inheritance -> composition via interfaces | Active Record disappears; persistence becomes repository; tests gain natural mocks |
| classic OO -> functional | mutable encapsulation -> immutability | methods with effects become pure functions + explicit update; state expressed as sequence of transformations |
| OO with DI -> event-driven | synchronous command -> event | return is no longer immediate; orchestration becomes choreography; ordering by key |
| OO with DI -> functional | mocks -> testable composition | DI stops being by interface, becomes by function argument |
| functional -> event-driven | synchronous composition -> messaging | latency increases; failure becomes a message in DLQ; distributed state |
| event-driven -> synchronous procedural | unnatural; only makes sense for small systems | collapse handlers into direct calls; loss of decoupling; strong consistency returns |
| dataflow -> event-driven | declarative DAG -> mutable choreography | control becomes less predictable; ordering must be guaranteed by key |
| actor model -> OO with DI | messages between actors -> synchronous calls | loss of fault isolation; supervision needs to become try/catch or orchestrated retry |

## Utility function (usage by the Paradigm Advisor)

Pseudo-procedure the agent follows when consulting the catalog:

1. Receive `legacy_paradigm` (detected) and `target_stack` (from the brief).
2. Look up `Stack -> natural paradigm mapping`, record `target_paradigm` and `alternatives`.
3. Compare `legacy_paradigm` with `target_paradigm`:
   - If equal: return `gap = none`, `implications = []`.
   - If different: look up `Typical gaps table by pair` and return `implications`.
4. If hybrid in legacy: apply step 3 for each component and return combined list.

## Catalog test scenarios (for validation)

1. procedural legacy + Node stack -> gap = procedural -> event-driven, implications = [synchrony/asynchronism, idempotency, retry/DLQ, ordering]
2. classic OO legacy + .NET 8 stack -> gap = classic OO -> OO with DI, implications = [inheritance/composition, repository, mocks]
3. classic OO legacy + Go stack -> gap = classic OO -> CSP, implications = [idiomatic interfaces, channels for coordination, loss of inheritance]
4. functional legacy + Elixir stack -> gap = functional -> actor model, implications = [distributed state, supervision, messages]
5. event-driven legacy + Node stack -> gap = none
6. COBOL batch legacy + TypeScript serverless stack -> extreme gap, multiple implications: batch -> event-driven, procedural -> rich typing, absence of long loops -> short invocations
7. monolithic Rails legacy + Hanami stack -> gap = classic OO (Active Record) -> OO with DI, implications = [repository, dry-monads optional]
8. hybrid legacy (Rails + Sidekiq) + Node stack -> hybrid decomposed: synchronous Rails part -> Node sync; async Sidekiq part -> Node modern queue
