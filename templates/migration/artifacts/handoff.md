# Handoff to the Coding Agent

> This document is the entry point for the coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.) that will write the new system from the specs.

## Mandatory reading first

1. **`paradigm_decision.md`**, non-negotiable reading. The target paradigm shapes how all coding must happen.

## Recommended reading order

1. `paradigm_decision.md` (mandatory, first)
2. `migration_brief.md`
3. `target_business_rules.md`
4. `migration_strategy.md`
5. `target_architecture.md`
6. `target_domain_model.md`
7. `target_data_model.md`
8. `data_migration_plan.md`
9. `parity_specs.md` + `parity_tests/`
10. `risk_register.md` + `cutover_plan.md`
11. `discard_log.md` (advisory)
12. `ambiguity_log.md` (advisory)

## Blockers before starting implementation
> Items that need a human decision before the coding agent can begin.

- <AMB-XXX: short description + where to decide>
- <or: no blockers, proceed>

## Next steps for the coding agent

1. **Read `paradigm_decision.md` and internalize**: the target paradigm is <from paradigm_decision>. Every code choice must honor this paradigm.
2. **Set up the new repository** with the stack declared in `migration_brief.md`.
3. **Implement bottom-up** following `target_architecture.md` and `target_domain_model.md`:
   - infrastructure -> data -> domain -> application -> boundaries.
4. **Write the tests** from `parity_specs.md` and `parity_tests/*.feature` from the start.
5. **For each component**, validate that it respects the chosen paradigm (explicit signals in `target_architecture.md section Honoring the chosen paradigm`).
6. **For data migration**, follow `data_migration_plan.md`.
7. **For the cutover**, follow `cutover_plan.md` and the go/no-go criteria.

## Auto-decided items (only if executed with --auto)
> List here items whose default was applied without human confirmation. Review before cutover is recommended.

- <or: pipeline executed in interactive mode, no auto-decided items>
